<h1>Log File Analyzer</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This Bash script is designed to analyze log files by providing three main functionalities: counting occurrences of a specific log level, extracting log entries that match a particular pattern, and summarizing overall log file information. The script includes functions to perform these tasks, such as count_log_level for counting occurrences of specified log levels (e.g., ERROR, WARNING), extract_pattern for extracting log entries that match a given pattern, and summarize_log for providing a summary of the log file, including total lines and counts of error and warning entries. The script accepts a log file as input and processes various options (-c, -e, -s) to perform the desired analysis. If no log file is provided, it displays usage instructions and available options.
